# How to Work With this Repo

1. You can just refer to it. If you need me to push something up so you can go to this repo and copy it, just say "Jeff, can you push your code"

2. Alternate between one and two as you see fit.

3. You just want to watch. Periodically, you can pull down a readonly copy of my code to review.

- Go to the repo.
- Click the Code button
- Copy the link it gives you.
- Go to a terminal/command prompt and navigate to your `~\dev` directory.
- Paste the link in. (this will copy it down.)
- `cd` into that directory and run `npm i` (to install the node modules).
- Open in Code and PARTY!

## Stuff for Tuesday
